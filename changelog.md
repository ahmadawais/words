### Fixed
- Removed textarea focus color states so input focus no longer shows green or gray highlights.
- Hardened analytics grids against overflow from very long, unbroken tokens used in prolonged stress tests.
- Ensured long values in the facts panel are clipped/truncated safely instead of breaking layout width.
